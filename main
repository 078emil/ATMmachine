    A Simple ATM Machine program.
    It include:
                Starting Balance
                Change Currency
                Balance change
                Withdraw and deposit
                Default Password
                Change Password
                Login/logout
                Hide the password after it has been typed wrong

    This was created for fun in my spare time. You are welcome to
    get inspiration and use the code for your own use WITH reference.

    NODE:
            This is not a secure program at all! It was not meant to
            be at all. Therefore, do not use it in any situation where
            security is vital!
